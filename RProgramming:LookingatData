| Whenever you're working with a new dataset, the first thing you should do is look at it!
| What is the format of the data? What are the dimensions? What are the variable names? How
| are the variables stored? Are there missing data? Are there any flaws in the data?

...

  |====                                                                                |   4%

| This lesson will teach you how to answer these questions and more using R's built-in
| functions. We'll be using a dataset constructed from the United States Department of
| Agriculture's PLANTS Database (http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html).

...

  |=======                                                                             |   8%

| I've stored the data for you in a variable called plants. Type ls() to list the variables
| in your workspace, among which should be plants.

| Excellent job!

  |==========                                                                          |  12%

| Let's begin by checking the class of the plants variable with class(plants). This will give
| us a clue as to the overall structure of the data.

> class(plants)
[1] "data.frame"

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |==============                                                                      |  17%

| It's very common for data to be stored in a data frame. It is the default class for data
| read into R using functions like read.csv() and read.table(), which you'll learn about in
| another lesson.

...

  |==================                                                                  |  21%

| Since the dataset is stored in a data frame, we know it is rectangular. In other words, it
| has two dimensions (rows and columns) and fits neatly into a table or spreadsheet. Use
| dim(plants) to see exactly how many rows and columns we're dealing with.

> dim(plants)
[1] 5166   10

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |=====================                                                               |  25%

| The first number you see (5166) is the number of rows (observations) and the second number
| (10) is the number of columns (variables).

...

  |========================                                                            |  29%

| You can also use nrow(plants) to see only the number of rows. Try it out.

> nrow(plants)
[1] 5166

| You got it!

  |============================                                                        |  33%

| ... And ncol(plants) to see only the number of columns.

> ncol(plants)
[1] 10

| You are really on a roll!

  |================================                                                    |  38%

| If you are curious as to how much space the dataset is occupying in memory, you can use
| object.size(plants).

> object.size(plants)
644232 bytes

| That's correct!

  |===================================                                                 |  42%

| Now that we have a sense of the shape and size of the dataset, let's get a feel for what's
| inside. names(plants) will return a character vector of column (i.e. variable) names. Give
| it a shot.

> inside.names(plants)
Error: could not find function "inside.names"
> inside. names(plants)
Error: unexpected symbol in "inside. names"
> names(plants)

[10] "Temp_Min_F"          

| Keep working like that and you'll get there!

  |======================================                                              |  46%

| We've applied fairly descriptive variable names to this dataset, but that won't always be
| the case. A logical next step is to peek at the actual data. However, our dataset contains
| over 5000 observations (rows), so it's impractical to view the whole thing all at once.

| The head() function allows you to preview the top of the dataset. Give it a try with only
| one argument.

| Take a minute to look through and understand the the output above. Each row is labeled with
| the observation number and each column with the variable name. Your screen is probably not
| wide enough to view all 10 columns side-by-side, in which case R displays as many columns
| as it can on each line before continuing on the next.

| By default, head() shows you the first six rows of the data. You can alter this behavior by
| passing as a second argument the number of rows you'd like to view. Use head() to preview
| the first 10 rows of plants.

| summary() provides different output for each variable, depending on its class. For numeric
| data such as Precip_Min, summary() displays the minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd
| quartile, and maximum. These values help us understand how the data are distributed.

...

| For categorical variables (called 'factor' variables in R), summary() displays the number
| of times each value (or 'level') occurs in the data. For example, each value of
| Scientific_Name only appears once, since it is unique to a specific plant. In contrast, the
| summary for Duration (also a factor variable) tells us that our dataset contains 3031
| Perennial plants, 682 Annual plants, etc.

...

  |==================================================================                  |  79%

| You can see that R truncated the summary for Active_Growth_Period by including a catch-all
| category called 'Other'. Since it is a categorical/factor variable, we can see how many
| times each value actually occurs in the data with table(plants$Active_Growth_Period).

| Perhaps the most useful and concise function for understanding the *str*ucture of your data
| is str(). Give it a try now.

| The beauty of str() is that it combines many of the features of the other functions you've
| already seen, all in a concise and readable format. At the very top, it tells us that the
| class of plants is 'data.frame' and that it has 5166 observations and 10 variables. It then
| gives us the name and class of each variable, as well as a preview of its contents.

  |================================================================================    |  96%

| str() is actually a very general function that you can use on most objects in R. Any time
| you want to understand the structure of something (a dataset, function, etc.), str() is a
| good place to start.

| In this lesson, you learned how to get a feel for the structure and contents of a new
| dataset using a collection of simple and useful functions. Taking the time to do this
| upfront can save you time and frustration later on in your analysis.
